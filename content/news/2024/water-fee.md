## Water Fee ##

The City of Manchester is currently installing a new water distribution system designed to improve water clarity and reduce contaminants in potable water. To help fund this project, the City has decided to implement a monthly water availability charge of $25.00 for each property that receives City water or has a water service line. This fee will take effect in January 2025. You can view the full letter sent to residents [here](/pdf/Water_Fee.pdf).

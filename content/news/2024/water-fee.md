The City of Manchester is in the process of installing a new water distribution system. To  help  pay  for  the  new  water  system  the  City  has  determined  that  each  property  that receives  City  water/or  has  a  water  service  line  shall  be  charged  a  monthly  water availability charge of $25.00.  This fee will start January 2025. You can find the entire letter that was sent to residents [here](/pdf/Water_Fee.pdf).
